# Covid-Data-Exploration-with-SQL

Covid 19 pandemic have had several short-term as well as long term impacts on human health, society, economy and environment. A pandemic which broke out in 2019 created significant knock-on effects on the daily life of citizens, as well as about the global economy.

Presently the impacts of COVID-19 in daily life are extensive and have far reaching consequences.

In this project, I analyzed and explored covid data with SQL using Micrsoft SQL Server Management Studio.

This covid-19 data was sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths) starting from December, 20-19 to 5th March, 2021.
